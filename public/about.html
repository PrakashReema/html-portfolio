<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Reema Devi, MBA in Marketing & Finance. I was doing good in sales for 2.5 years but suddenly I develop deep love for coding.
  I want to know how website works, how to create one so I joined udemy's complete web deveopment bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu.

<p>I believe the businesses can be develpoed by connecting worldwide so it is necessary to go online. For me learining website development is the 1st step to understand the wisdom of internet.</p>

<p>Lastly, I will say I am visionary person and I like learning new things to challenge myself.</p>
